Near Block A, 
CCET(DG), Sector 26</a>

When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a 
while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at 
Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and 
artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not 
so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have 
no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it 
a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing 
drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

Raspberry Italian soda </p>

<p class = "item-text">Nubz is cafe/bar newly opened in sector 
26. The interiors are done well with a mixture of modern age designing with 
classic old school comfort.<br>
The place is divided into three areas basically which is the 
indoor lounge, the outdoor and rooftop seating.<br>
The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone to 
the restaurant where as the outdoor seating is comparatively more modern with 
Graffiti's and funky wall frames.<br>
An ideal place to chill and relax.<br>

I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing 
Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a 
Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean 
Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I 
ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.

Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its 
cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh and fruity 
beverage before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor 
and outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny day, take a break on the patio 
with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.
